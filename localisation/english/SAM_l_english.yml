To compensate for this, we should attempt to acquire arms through smuggling operations from the east, where the American garrison may leave some of their equipment unguarded and vulnerable to retrieval. By securing these supplies, we can strengthen our forces in the short term." #\n\nHowever, once we have developed a domestic arms industry capable of producing our own equipment, we can cease these operations into §R[1088.GetName]§! and focus on self-sufficiency. <--- Cut this due to it making category look weird. thank you simpy for the description!
