 new_zealand.1.d: "With the ever growing tension, the fragmented state of the Labor Party, we must look to choose a successor to the ever sickening Michael Joseph Savage. Peter Fraser has proven himself to be a more then capable leader, and has came highly endorsed by both Walter Nash as well as Prime Minister Savage. However, this does not stop Savage's opposition led by Gervan McMillan from trying to push their agenda even harder, McMillan, the more controversial choice, has expressed sympathies for extradited Labor member John A. Lee, making him profusely unpopular."

The Labor Party has been leading the nation for quite some time, and has promised to pass the Social Security Act which promises to give old age pensions and unemployment benefits. This has been proven to been excellent leverage over the National Party, who open criticizes Labor Party policies. The National Party, although new, has been increasing in popularity over its years, and has rallied support by exploiting the weaknesses of the Labor government. While the election is most likely in favor of the Labor Party, there is a chance the National Party could prove otherwise."

Only time will tell if the Legion can become a major party in New Zealand's future."
 new_zealand.4.a: "The Legion is the best hope for the future of New Zealand."
 new_zealand.5.t: "Communist Papers Spread Through the Nation"
 new_zealand.5.d: "Strange Newspapers have been increasingly spreading in major cities, advocating for a new system directly opposed to the ideals of the Legion Remnants and Labor Party. No one can find the source fo these papers, besides it is believed they are coming from possible hiding places in the rural countryside. Some of become more agitated as a result, riots have broken out across the nation demanding the removal of all government officials, as well as an end to the Legion and its leader Ormond. The leaderless Labor Party seems likely to comply, however Ormond has threatened to fight back the riots with his own supporters."
 new_zealand.5.a: "Step down, the communists out number us."
 new_zealand.5.b: "Crack down on these riots immediately, they will own worsen our situation."
 new_zealand.6.t: "Governor General Rallies Loyalists"
 new_zealand.6.d: "With New Zealand's state as a dominion questioned, and the monarchy returning to full power in Britain, many parties are suggesting independence. However, a strong loyalist movement led by Governor General George Monckton-Arundell, is attempting to solidify control in the nation. This movement has already sparked open combat between the radical parties in the streets of Wellington, leading some to question the security of the nation."
 new_zealand.6.a: "Let the Governor make his demands, New Zealand stands with Britain."
