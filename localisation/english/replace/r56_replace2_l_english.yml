 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As dusk settled on the Russian, Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires following the end of the Great War, Romania, who had fought on the side of the Entente, was now the undisputed hegemon of the Balkans.\nHowever, not all is well in the nation. The country's frail democracy has been in a power struggle with King Carol ever since the beginning of his reign, with Codreanu's Iron Guard waiting for their opportunity to strike.\nNow, with a resurgent Germany looking to expand it's influence in the Balkans, and a new Communist threat to the East eyeing it's former territories, Romania must pick its friends carefully, lest an old enemy come knocking."
